<h1 id="stress-%26-trauma">Stress &amp; Trauma</h1>
<h2 id="stress">Stress</h2>
<p>Player characters in <em>Blades in the Dark</em> have a special reserve called <strong>stress</strong>. When they suffer a consequence that they don’t want to accept, they can take stress instead. The result of the <strong>resistance roll</strong> determines how much stress it costs to avoid a bad outcome.</p>
<p><em>During a knife fight, Daniel’s character, Cross, gets stabbed in the chest. Daniel rolls his <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> rating to resist, and gets a <span class="game-term">2</span>. It costs 6 stress, minus 2 (the result of the resistance roll) to resist the consequences. Daniel marks off 4 stress and describes how Cross survives.</em></p>
<p><em>The GM rules that the harm is reduced by the resistance roll, but not avoided entirely. Cross suffers level 2 harm (“Chest Wound”) instead of level 3 harm (“Punctured Lung”).</em></p>
<h2 id="pushing-yourself">Pushing Yourself</h2>
<p>You can use stress to push yourself for greater performance. For each bonus you choose below, take <strong>2 stress</strong> (each can be chosen once for a given action):</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <strong>+1d</strong> to your roll. (This may be used for an action roll or downtime roll or any other kind of roll where extra effort would help you)</li>
<li>Add <strong>+1 level</strong> to your effect.</li>
<li>Take action when you’re incapacitated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trauma">Trauma</h2>
<p>When a PC marks their last stress box, they suffer a level of <span class="game-term">trauma</span>. When you take <span class="game-term">trauma</span>, circle one of your <strong>trauma conditions</strong> like <em>Cold</em>, <em>Reckless</em>, <em>Unstable</em>, etc. They’re all described on the next page.</p>
<p>When you suffer <span class="game-term">trauma</span>, you’re taken out of action. You’re “left for dead” or otherwise dropped out of the current conflict, only to come back later, shaken and drained. When you return, <strong>you have zero stress</strong> and your vice has been satisfied for the next downtime.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma conditions are permanent</strong>. Your character acquires the new personality quirk indicated by the condition, and can earn xp by using it to cause trouble. <strong>When you mark your fourth trauma condition</strong>, your character cannot continue as a daring scoundrel. You must retire them to a different life or send them to prison to take the fall for the crew’s <span class="game-term">wanted level</span>.</p>
<h3 id="trauma-conditions">Trauma Conditions</h3>
<ul>
<li><span class="game-term">Cold</span>: You’re not moved by emotional appeals or social bonds.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Haunted</span>: You’re often lost in reverie, reliving past horrors, seeing things.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Obsessed</span>: You’re enthralled by one thing: an activity, a person, an ideology.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Paranoid</span>: You imagine danger everywhere; you can’t trust others.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Reckless</span>: You have little regard for your own safety or best interests.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Soft</span>: You lose your edge; you become sentimental, passive, gentle.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Unstable</span>: Your emotional state is volatile. You can instantly rage, or fall into despair, act impulsively, or freeze up.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Vicious</span>: You seek out opportunities to hurt people, even for no good reason.</li>
</ul>
